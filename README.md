# FundMe Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a FundMe contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat test:staging
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat lint
yarn hardhat lint:fix
yarn hardhat format
yarn hardhat coverage
```
